## Seed Candidates
- `id`: `v5_2_candidate_streaming_001`
- `title`: `Streaming / partial result delivery`
- `problem`: `Large result sets force clients to wait for full materialization, which increases timeout risk and makes progressive UX difficult in long-running exports.`
- `why_not_v5_1_delta`: `v5.1 result APIs are shaped around complete retrieval and do not include a partial-delivery surface.`
- `candidate_fixtures`: `fixtures/v5_2/candidates/streaming/`
- `touches_scheduling_or_policy_integration`: `no`
- `deterministic_invariants`: `TBD`
- `non_goals`: `TBD`
- `open_questions`: `What unit defines a stream chunk (row, byte window, logical page); how stream cursors relate to existing result cursors; how completion is represented when stream output is truncated or empty.`

- `id`: `v5_2_candidate_scheduling_001`
- `title`: `Wall-clock scheduling / background workers`
- `problem`: `Execution timing and async processing are currently out of scope.`
- `why_not_v5_1_delta`: `v5.1 non-goals excluded wall-clock scheduling and workers.`
- `candidate_fixtures`: `fixtures/v5_2/candidates/scheduling/`
- `deterministic_invariants`: `TBD`
- `non_goals`: `TBD`
- `open_questions`: `Clock abstraction, retry timing, queue semantics, cancellation windows.`

- `id`: `v5_2_candidate_retention_axis_001`
- `title`: `Retention axis expansion beyond poll-count`
- `problem`: `External compliance and data-governance practices often reference elapsed time or event age, which is hard to map directly onto poll-count-only expiry.`
- `why_not_v5_1_delta`: `v5.1 explicitly fixes retention evaluation to poll-count, so additional axes are outside that frozen model.`
- `candidate_fixtures`: `fixtures/v5_2/candidates/retention_axis/`
- `touches_scheduling_or_policy_integration`: `no`
- `deterministic_invariants`: `TBD`
- `non_goals`: `TBD`
- `open_questions`: `How multi-axis precedence is communicated when poll-count and non-poll signals disagree; how same-step tie handling is represented across axes; how visibility outcomes are expressed during axis migration windows.`

- `id`: `v5_2_candidate_lifecycle_001`
- `title`: `Lifecycle semantics beyond v5.1 staging model`
- `problem`: `Current staged lifecycle may not describe operator workflows such as longer operator holds, multi-phase restart paths, or richer interruption taxonomies.`
- `why_not_v5_1_delta`: `v5.1 lifecycle transitions and staging states are frozen as delta-complete for that release line.`
- `candidate_fixtures`: `fixtures/v5_2/candidates/lifecycle/`
- `touches_scheduling_or_policy_integration`: `yes`
- `touch_note`: `Lifecycle expansions can pull in scheduling-style execution windows when pause/resume intent is time-aware.`
- `deterministic_invariants`: `TBD`
- `non_goals`: `TBD`
- `open_questions`: `Which additional operator-visible states are meaningfully distinct from existing staging; how transition readability is preserved as the matrix grows; how rollback narratives remain understandable with added state paths.`

- `id`: `v5_2_candidate_policy_integration_001`
- `title`: `Policy/job integration beyond non-interpreting boundary`
- `problem`: `Some flows may require policy-aware execution decisions.`
- `why_not_v5_1_delta`: `v5.1 locked job APIs as non-interpreting for policy outcomes.`
- `candidate_fixtures`: `fixtures/v5_2/candidates/policy_integration/`
- `deterministic_invariants`: `TBD`
- `non_goals`: `TBD`
- `open_questions`: `Interpretation boundary, explainability, failure mapping.`

## Initial Out-of-Scope (Non-Binding)
- `v5_2_candidate_scheduling_001`: depends on wall-clock and background execution assumptions that would require cross-cutting runtime model changes.
- `v5_2_candidate_policy_integration_001`: assumes crossing the v5.1 non-interpreting boundary and would require semantics that span policy and job layers.
