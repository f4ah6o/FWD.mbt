# v5.2 Plan (Open)

This document opens v5.2 planning.
It does not freeze semantics.

## Baseline
- v5.1.0 is the immutable upstream baseline.
- v5.0 and v5.1 fixtures/anchors remain unchanged unless explicitly versioned as v5.2 artifacts.

## Planning Status
- State: `open`
- Freeze status: `not started`
- Scope status: `focused exploration`

## Planning Direction (Non-Binding)
- v5.2 planning focus: generalize retention from single-axis poll-count to multi-axis retention.
- Explicit exclusion in this planning direction: wall-clock axis is not introduced.
- This direction is exploratory and does not start freeze.

## Candidate Scope (Parking Lot)
- Streaming or partial result delivery
- Wall-clock scheduling or background worker model
- Retention axis expansion beyond poll-count
- Additional lifecycle semantics not representable as v5.1 delta
- Policy/job integration changes beyond v5.1 non-interpreting boundary

## v5.2 Guardrails
- Keep delta-first versioning discipline.
- Encode semantics through fixtures before implementation changes.
- Separate core decisions from optional surfaces.
- Record explicit non-goals for each freeze cycle.

## Entry Criteria For Draft Freeze
- Candidate scope narrowed to a minimal coherent set.
- New fixture families named and scaffolded under `fixtures/v5_2/`.
- Deterministic invariants written before runtime behavior changes.
